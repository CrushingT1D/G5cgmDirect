# G5cgmDirect

A iOS framework providing an interface for communicating with the G5 glucose transmitter over Bluetooth. The inspiration comes from [xDripG5](http://github.com/LoopKit/xDripG5), a breakthrough application to allow reading of G5 data as part of LoopKit.

*Please note this project is neither created nor backed by Dexcom, Inc. This software is not intended for use in therapy.*

## Requirements

This framework connects to a G5 Mobile Transmitter via Bluetooth LE. It does not connect to the G4 Share Receiver or any earlier CGM products.
